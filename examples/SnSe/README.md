## Discrepancies

1. Using mpiPyMC, I am not able to plot the phase transition as published in [paper](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.097601). The T_c I got for FE to turn PE is around 180K, this value is similar to the one for SnTe, which makes sense.

2. This is a minor error. The spontaneous polarization value at ZERO K is around 1.45, this does not agree with the one they provided in the paper (1.51).
